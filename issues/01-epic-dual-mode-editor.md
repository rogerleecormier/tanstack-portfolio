# Epic — Dual-Mode Markdown/HTML Editor (Free Stack)

**Labels:** epic

## Description

Goal: Ship a free, extensible editor with Markdown as canonical, an HTML WYSIWYG visual mode, a single accurate real-time HTML preview, and schema-validated fenced JSON blocks that round-trip intact.

Scope: Issues 1–14 in this pack.

Done when: All child issues meet acceptance criteria; sample files (`about.md`, `project-method-analysis-budget-tiers-complexity (2).md`) pass the QA checklist.
