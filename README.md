# TanStack Portfolio

A modern portfolio website built with React, TanStack Router, and Vite.

## Routing Setup

This application uses **normal routing** (not hash routing) for clean, SEO-friendly URLs:

- **Development**: Clean URLs like `http://localhost:5174/strategy`, `http://localhost:5174/leadership`
- **Production**: Clean URLs like `yoursite.com/strategy`, `yoursite.com/leadership`

### Hosting Platform Compatibility

The app includes intelligent routing support for different hosting platforms:

- **Cloudflare Pages**: Native SPA routing support (no workarounds needed)
- **Netlify**: Uses the `public/_redirects` file
- **Vercel**: Uses the `vercel.json` configuration
- **GitHub Pages**: Uses the included routing scripts (only on github.io domains)
- **Other platforms**: Most modern hosting platforms support SPA routing natively

### Routing Script Logic

The routing script in `index.html` only runs on GitHub Pages domains (`*.github.io`) and excludes:
- Localhost (development)
- Cloudflare Pages (`*.pages.dev`, `*.cloudflare.com`)
- Netlify (`*.netlify.app`, `*.netlify.com`)
- Vercel (`*.vercel.app`, `*.vercel.com`)
- Firebase (`*.firebaseapp.com`, `*.web.app`)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Sidebar Navigation

- **Portfolio Navigation:**  
  Main site sections (About, Analytics & Insights, Strategy, Leadership, Talent, DevOps, ERP/SaaS).

  Each project (e.g., HealthBridge) is listed as a top-level link with its own icon.  
  Project analysis pages (e.g., HealthBridge Analysis, Projects Analysis) are also included.

### Routing

- Example routes:
  - `/` ‚Äî About
  - `/analytics` ‚Äî Analytics & Insights
  - `/project-analysis` ‚Äî Projects Analysis
  - `/healthbridge-analysis` ‚Äî HealthBridge Analysis

### Charting

- HealthBridge uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for data visualization.
- Chart colors and aggregation logic are configurable in code.

### Deployment

- **GitHub Actions** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) automates build and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Uses Node.js 20, Vite, and [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages).
