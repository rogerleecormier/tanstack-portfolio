# TanStack Portfolio

A modern portfolio website built with React, TanStack Router, and Vite.

## Routing Setup

This application uses **normal routing** (not hash routing) for clean, SEO-friendly URLs:

- **Development**: Clean URLs like `http://localhost:5174/strategy`, `http://localhost:5174/leadership`
- **Production**: Clean URLs like `yoursite.com/strategy`, `yoursite.com/leadership`

### GitHub Pages Compatibility

The app includes special handling for GitHub Pages deployment:
- **404.html**: Fallback page for direct navigation
- **index.html**: Contains routing script that only runs in production
- **Router**: Uses `createBrowserHistory()` for normal routing

### Deployment Options

1. **GitHub Pages**: Works with the included routing scripts
2. **Netlify**: Use the `public/_redirects` file
3. **Vercel**: Use the `vercel.json` configuration
4. **Other platforms**: Most modern hosting platforms support SPA routing natively

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```
