    "content": "Transformation is more than replacing tools — it’s about **connecting people, processes, and technology into resilient systems**. My strategy is to move organizations away from fragmented, spreadsheet-driven workflows toward **API-first, cloud-native ecosystems** where governance, adoption, and measurable impact are built-in.  \r\n\r\nI approach strategy with a **leader’s vision and an operator’s discipline**: clear direction, pragmatic frameworks, and sustainable execution.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧭 Strategy Pillars\r\n\r\n- **Process Modernization** — encode rules at the source, remove manual handoffs  \r\n- **API-First Integration** — NetSuite, Ramp, Vena, Box, Smartsheet connected through Azure Functions & Cloudflare Workers  \r\n- **Governance-by-Design** — approvals, reconciliation, and audit evidence embedded into workflows  \r\n- **Adoption & Enablement** — rollout playbooks, quick-start guides, feedback loops  \r\n- **Observability & Metrics** — dashboards tied to OKRs, risk triggers, and decision points  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📂 Portfolio Highlights\r\n\r\n### 💳 Accounts Payable Transformation (Ramp + NetSuite)\r\n- Migrated AP from manual spreadsheets → automated workflows with GL mapping and sync validation  \r\n- Reduced cycle time by ~40%  \r\n- Delivered real-time saved search reports for audit visibility  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 📦 Forecast Streamlining (Box → Vena)\r\n- Enforced folder standards + schema validation  \r\n- Automated ingestion pipelines, tracked via Smartsheet dashboards  \r\n- Cut ingestion errors by 50%; accelerated forecast cycles by 1 day  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🛠 Custom Utilities\r\n- **CalPERS XLSX → XML converter** for state reporting  \r\n- **Smartsheet indexers** to reduce duplication and improve intake  \r\n- **NetSuite CSV ingestion pipelines** to reduce manual prep  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧰 Operating Model\r\n\r\n1. **Intake** — capture needs through structured requests (Asana, Smartsheet, Vertex Hub)  \r\n2. **Scoring** — rank by impact × effort, risk exposure, and compliance need  \r\n3. **Governance Gates** — align with executive sponsors, validate scope, define measures of success  \r\n4. **Delivery Rituals** — Agile/Hybrid cadence depending on risk/complexity  \r\n5. **Evidence on Cadence** — dashboards, saved searches, and audit trails for stakeholders  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🌱 Career Vision\r\n\r\nMy near-term goal is to continue driving **ERP modernization and SaaS transformation** at scale. Long-term, I am preparing for executive technology leadership roles (CTO, VP Strategy, PMO Leader) supported by completing a **Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)** in Digital Strategy & Technology Leadership.  \r\n\r\nI aim to **mentor and empower the next generation of leaders**, building teams that thrive in complexity and deliver sustainable outcomes.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🌟 Closing Thought\r\n\r\nThe best strategy makes transformation feel invisible — users just know work got easier and results arrived faster.  \r\n\r\n> *“Strategy is choices; execution is systems.”*",

    "content": "Technology alone doesn’t scale organizations — people do. I apply **systems-thinking to workforce design**, creating structures and practices that grow capability, embed equity, and sustain high performance.  \r\n\r\nI bring the discipline of a military leader and the empathy of a servant leader to design organizations that are **clear, inclusive, and future-ready**.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧭 Talent Principles\r\n\r\n- **Clarity of Roles** — eliminate ambiguity through documented responsibilities and outcomes  \r\n- **Leadership Pipelines** — structured mentorship and coaching pathways that accelerate readiness  \r\n- **Feedback Systems** — normalize feedback loops across teams, projects, and leaders  \r\n- **Equity & Inclusion** — build frameworks that reduce bias in hiring, promotion, and evaluation  \r\n- **ROI on Talent** — align workforce planning with measurable outcomes (delivery, retention, engagement)  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📂 Talent in Action\r\n\r\n### 🪖 Military Mentorship → Enterprise Pipelines\r\n- Built mentorship programs that produced promotable leaders in compressed timelines  \r\n- Translated into enterprise by creating **structured leadership readiness frameworks**  \r\n- **Impact**: ↑ leadership bench strength, ↓ time-to-readiness  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🎯 SaaS Rollout Teams\r\n- Designed **cross-functional squads** for Ramp and Vertex Hub rollouts  \r\n- Clarified roles (finance, ops, IT) with outcome-based definitions  \r\n- **Impact**: faster adoption, less cross-team friction  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 🌐 Army Health Clinic → Civilian DEI\r\n- Applied DEI-conscious hiring practices tested in military contexts  \r\n- Implemented structured rubrics and onboarding playbooks  \r\n- **Impact**: ↑ diversity in hiring pipelines, ↑ engagement scores  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 📈 Talent Impact Metrics\r\n\r\n| Metric                     | Before               | After (My Work)        |\r\n|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\r\n| Leadership Readiness       | Informal, inconsistent | Structured pipeline, faster promotions |\r\n| Cross-Functional Clarity   | Role confusion       | Defined roles, smoother rollouts |\r\n| DEI Hiring Outcomes        | Variable             | Structured rubrics, ↑ diversity |\r\n| Retention & Engagement     | Flat/declining       | ↑ retention, ↑ engagement scores |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🌱 Philosophy\r\n\r\nGreat organizations don’t just hire talent — they **design for it**. Structures, rituals, and feedback loops create cultures where people can thrive.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🌟 Closing Thought\r\n\r\nOrganizations scale on people, not just tools. Culture and clarity turn individuals into high-performing teams.  \r\n\r\n> *“Skill is multiplied by systems and culture.”*",
