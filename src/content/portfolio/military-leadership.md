> "Leaders are not born; they are made through **values, knowledge, and action**."

I served as a **Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) in the U.S. Army Signal Corps**, where I led mission-critical communications teams supporting global operations. These experiences shaped the **leadership philosophy** I carry today: a commitment to **discipline, technical excellence, and servant leadership**.

## ðŸ§­ Leadership Philosophy â€” *Be â€¢ Know â€¢ Do*  
My leadership approach follows the Armyâ€™s timeless **Be-Know-Do** framework:

### **BE** â€” *Character and Values*  
- **Integrity under pressure** â†’ Leading communications during combat readiness meant making decisions where errors werenâ€™t an option.
- **Servant leadership** â†’ My teamâ€™s success always came before my own recognition.
- **Resilience** â†’ Adapting quickly when systems failed, resources were limited, or mission objectives shifted unexpectedly.

### **KNOW** â€” *Technical & Tactical Competence*  
- Mastered **WIN-T tactical networks**, RF systems, and satellite communications for global readiness.
- Led 24/7 **Network Operations Center (NOC)** teams maintaining 99.99% uptime under extreme conditions.
- Trained junior soldiers to achieve certifications ahead of schedule, creating future leaders while strengthening unit capability.

### **DO** â€” *Lead, Develop, Achieve*  
- Built **high-performing, cross-functional teams** capable of executing complex missions under compressed timelines.
- Set **clear expectations** and empowered soldiers with decision-making authority to build confidence and speed.
- Delivered **after-action reviews (AARs)** to continuously improve team performance and mission outcomes.

- **24/7 Readiness & Uptime** â†’ Led NOC teams under pressure, troubleshooting live network disruptions in seconds, not minutes.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Carries Forward Today  
The lessons from my military service directly inform my work as a **Technical Project Manager** and **strategic leader**:

- **Ownership & accountability** â†’ Focusing on measurable outcomes, not just activity.
- **Team development** â†’ Building feedback-driven cultures where people grow alongside the mission.
