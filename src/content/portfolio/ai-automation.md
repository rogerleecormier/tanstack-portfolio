I use AI where it’s **measurably useful**—in code generation, config authoring, reporting, and risk detection—while keeping humans in the loop for governance and change control.

---

## ⚙️ Delivery Acceleration
- AI‑assisted coding and config scaffolding for Python, SuiteScript, and PowerShell  
- Automated report generation and stakeholder summaries  
- Conversational research to speed solution design and documentation

**Illustrative results**  
- 5× faster delivery on scripting tasks; ≈100 developer‑hours/month reclaimed via automation‑assisted workflows

---

## 📊 Ops & Insights
- Risk surfacing from work management tools (missed deadlines, velocity dips)  
- Scheduled exports and dashboards for executive reviews  
- Alerts tied to operational thresholds in ingestion pipelines

---

## 🧰 What I Use
ChatGPT and allied LLMs, Copilot, Asana AI; GitHub Actions; serverless runtimes for scheduled jobs.
