As a Technical Project Manager, I lead cross-functional initiatives that blend **product delivery, system integration, and DevOps strategy**. My leadership style is pragmatic, systems-oriented, and focused on aligning people, platforms, and processes to deliver measurable business value—without unnecessary complexity.

I bring a **culture of clarity, ownership, and accountability** to every team, moving fluidly between engineers, analysts, product owners, and executive sponsors to turn ambiguity into structure.
