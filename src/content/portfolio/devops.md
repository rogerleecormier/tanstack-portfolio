I operate at the crossroads of **product leadership** and **hands-on engineering**, turning fragmented SaaS ecosystems into automated, audit-ready pipelines. My projects remove manual toil, harden release governance, and surface real-time insights for hundreds of users—while keeping compliance teams happy.

## ⚡ DevOps Philosophy
> *"Velocity without traceability is vanity; true DevOps balances shipped value with defensible compliance."*

From serverless ETL to CI/CD workflow hardening, I focus on sustainable automation that teams can **trust, audit, and maintain**—not just one-off fixes.
