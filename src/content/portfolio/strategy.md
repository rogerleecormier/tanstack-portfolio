description: "Leading initiatives that modernize legacy workflows into cloud-native, API-connected systems with measurable business impact and audit-ready governance."

I lead initiatives that transform **legacy, spreadsheet-driven workflows** into **cloud-native, API-connected systems**. My goal: deliver measurable impact that finance and operations teams adopt without friction—complete with audit trails, real-time reporting, and sustainable governance.

Long-term, I aim to expand from tactical execution into **enterprise-level technology leadership**, focusing on governance, portfolio management, and cross-platform transformation.
