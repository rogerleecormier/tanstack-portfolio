description: "From requirements and service blueprints to MVPs teams will actually adopt—grounded in operations and measurable outcomes."
---

I translate operational needs into **clear product requirements, service blueprints, and MVPs** that teams adopt with minimal friction. I prioritize **tool usability, data integrity, and measurable outcomes** over feature volume.

---

## ✍️ How I Work
- Collaborative discovery: interviews, current‑state mapping, pain‑point analysis  
- Service blueprints: where people, data, and tools interact (and where to remove toil)  
- MVP framing: smallest slice that returns real value with clear success thresholds  
- Adoption strategy: training, quick‑start guides, and metrics that prove it’s working

---

## 🧪 Representative Work
- Vendor/tool scoring for **native integrations, governance, UX, and automation potential**  
- Requirements, wireframes, and field mappings for finance and operations workflows  
- Cross‑functional comms for distributed teams to keep adoption smooth

---

## 🧰 Tooling
Visio / diagramming tools, low‑/no‑code prototypes, Smartsheet / Asana for task orchestration, NetSuite and allied finance platforms for real‑world constraints.
