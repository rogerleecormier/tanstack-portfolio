title: "ERP & SaaS Integration"
description: "Designing and governing secure, low-friction workflows across NetSuite, Ramp, Vena, and enterprise systems with automated data flows and compliance controls."
---

My portfolio includes **hands-on leadership of ERP and financial SaaS ecosystems**—designing, integrating, and governing data flow between platforms like NetSuite, Ramp, Vena, Checkbook.io, Box, and Smartsheet.

As a **NetSuite administrator and cross-platform integrator**, I build secure, low-friction workflows across teams, tools, and APIs.

## 🛠️ Platforms Managed
- **ERP Core:** NetSuite (financials, AP, workflows, integrations)  
- **Finance Tools:** Ramp, Checkbook.io, Vena Solutions  
- **Automation:** Power Automate, SuiteScript, Python connectors
