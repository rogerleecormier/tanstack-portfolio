title: "Governance & PMO"
description: "Pragmatic governance that raises delivery quality without slowing teams—RAG/RAID, SOPs, approvals, and audit-ready ops."
---

I run **governance as an accelerator**—codifying just enough structure to reduce risk while keeping velocity high. My approach combines **RAG/RAID dashboards, SOPs, approval workflows, and automated validations** embedded directly in the tools teams already use.

---

## 🎯 What Governance Looks Like in Practice

- **RAG / RAID at portfolio and workstream levels** with crisp, executive-ready rollups  
- **Change control & approvals** enforced in systems (NetSuite, Smartsheet, Power Automate) rather than slideware  
- **SOPs & templates** for scope, comms plans, risk registers, and rollout playbooks  
- **Validation & reconciliation** as part of the delivery workflow, not after-the-fact audits  
- **Traceability**: decisions, mappings, and data lineage captured where work happens

---

## 🔎 Representative Artifacts

- Scope & success measures one-pagers  
- Risk register with owner, trigger, and response plan  
- Stakeholder comms matrix (audience × message × cadence)  
- UAT plan with pass/fail, evidence, and cutover checklist  
- Post-deploy monitoring playbook (targets, alerts, rollback cues)

---

## 🧪 Case Studies (Selected)

### Ramp ↔ NetSuite (AP Governance)
- GL mapping and sync validation embedded in platform workflows  
- Result: **Reduced manual effort** and improved AP accuracy and visibility into AP aging

### Box → Vena Forecast Intake (Portfolio Visibility)
- Folder standards, naming conventions, and submission tracking dashboards  
- Result: **Better traceability**, fewer delays, stronger template compliance

### Financial Reporting QA (Review & Evidence)
- Smartsheet review system for budget/forecast uploads with file locations and timestamps  
- Result: **Reduced missed submissions** and faster ingestion downstream

---

## 📊 Operating Metrics I Emphasize
- SLA adherence, backlog aging, and sprint predictability  
- Exception rates (ingestion failures, mismatches), recovery time, and rework  
- “Time to signal” for risks and issues; % with owner + response plan

---

## 🧰 Tools & Systems
Smartsheet, NetSuite (saved searches, approvals), Power Automate, Box, Asana, GitHub Actions.
