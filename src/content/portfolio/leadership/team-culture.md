Focus on outcomes, not just activity.

Encourage respectful debate; strong ideas often emerge from healthy tension.

**Cross-Functional Partnership**  
Connect technical, operational, and executive perspectives to close gaps.

**Growth Through Feedback**  
Give and receive feedback directly and constructively to build maturity and trust.
