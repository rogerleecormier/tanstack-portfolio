title: "Risk & Compliance"
description: "Building validation, reconciliation, and audit evidence into day‑to‑day workflows across finance and operations."
---

My risk posture is **controls-in-the-flow**: rules, validations, and reconciliation live inside the tools—producing **automatic audit evidence** and fewer surprises at month‑end.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles
1. **Interoperability**: clear system-of-record per data type  
2. **Validation at source**: approvals, GL rules, and field checks where data is created  
3. **Reconciliation by design**: scheduled cross-system checks, not ad hoc hunts  
4. **Observability**: logs, alerts, dashboards wired to operational thresholds

## 🔐 Patterns I Implement
- Saved searches and conditional logic in ERP for **multi-entity compliance**  
- Approval routing that reflects actual authority paths (no shadow processes)  
- Naming conventions and folder standards to prevent ingestion drift  
- Scheduled report delivery for **evidence on cadence**

---

## 📂 Examples
- **Payments:** ACH workflow to an external provider with end‑to‑end logging and duplicate prevention  
- **Forecasts:** Box → Vena pipelines with schema checks and file validation  
- **AP:** Sync accuracy checks between card transactions, invoices, and GL coding

---

## 📈 What Gets Measured
- Exceptions caught at source vs. downstream  
- % automated approvals vs. manual escalations  
- Time to reconcile + number of unreconciled items over time
