I'm a **PMP-certified Technical Project Manager** and **U.S. Army veteran** who thrives at the intersection of **technology, governance, and leadership**. My mission is to take **fragmented, spreadsheet-driven workflows** and transform them into **cloud-native, API-first, AI-augmented ecosystems** that are reliable, auditable, and trusted by users.

My journey began as a **Signal Corps Non-Commissioned Officer**, where I learned that uptime was mission-critical and clarity could mean the difference between success and failure. Those lessons inform my work today: whether it's ERP modernization, SaaS integrations, or AI-assisted DevOps, I focus on delivering systems that people can rely on â€” and teams can scale with.

## ðŸª– Military Roots

As a **Signal Corps NCO**, I led global communication operations and 24/7 Network Operations Centers supporting missions with 99.99% uptime. I trained and mentored soldiers into leaders, introduced structured mentorship programs that raised certification pass rates, and directed high-stakes deployments under limited resources.

These experiences built my leadership DNA:
- **Be** â€” character and integrity under pressure  
- **Know** â€” technical competence and stakeholder fluency  
- **Do** â€” execution with clarity, urgency, and ownership
