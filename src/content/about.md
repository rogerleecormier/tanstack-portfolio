I specialize in modernizing legacy systems, integrating enterprise tools, and aligning cross-functional teams around systems thinking and practical execution.

## ✝️ Values & Personal Ethic

I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father of five—and those commitments shape how I lead. I approach work with a sense of stewardship, integrity, and service.

I don't bring religion into the workplace, but I lead with consistency, humility, and the belief that leadership is about responsibility to others—not authority over them.

---

## 🧭 Leadership Philosophy

> *"Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge and delivering outcomes that matter."*

Whether leading cross-functional teams through complex integrations or mentoring junior staff through technical challenges, my approach centers on clarity, accountability, and service—creating environments where people can do their best work while delivering measurable business value.
