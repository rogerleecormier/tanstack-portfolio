## ✝️ Values & Personal Ethic

I'm a Christian, a husband, and a father of five—and those commitments shape how I lead. I approach work with a sense of stewardship, integrity, and service.

I don’t bring religion into the workplace, but I lead with consistency, humility, and the belief that leadership is about responsibility to others—not authority over them.

## 🧠 Leadership Philosophy

| Principle               | Behavior in Practice                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Systems over silos      | I design for integration and sustainability, not isolation            |
| Clarity is non-negotiable | I surface ambiguity early and align teams around shared understanding |
| Respect as a standard   | I challenge ideas, not people—and I lead by example                   |
| Calm under pressure     | I bring structure, not panic, when uncertainty hits                   |
| Outcomes over activity  | I define success by delivery, adoption, and durability—not effort     |
