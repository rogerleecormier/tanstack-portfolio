## Professional Foundation: Military Service & Leadership

My professional foundation was built through **U.S. Army service**, where I specialized in **satellite and RF communications technology**. This experience taught me the critical importance of reliable, mission-critical systems and the leadership skills necessary to operate in high-stakes environments.

### Key Military Experience

- **Operation New Dawn Deployment**: Played an essential role in the drawdown of the Iraq conflict
- **Satellite & RF Communications**: Ensured reliable mission-critical systems in challenging environments
- **Leadership Training**: Both received and provided leadership training to teams
- **Strategic Planning**: Coordinated complex operations with multiple stakeholders and tight deadlines

The leadership principles I learned during military service continue to influence my approach to project management and team development. I learned that true leadership is about serving others, making difficult decisions with integrity, and always putting the mission and team first.

I believe that true leadership in the digital age requires an insatiable thirst for knowledge and the humility to recognize that learning never ends. Every degree, certification, and skill I've acquired represents not just achievement, but a stepping stone toward greater understanding and capability.
