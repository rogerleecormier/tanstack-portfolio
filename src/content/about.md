My mission is to take **fragmented, spreadsheet-driven workflows** and transform them into **cloud-native, API-first, AI-augmented ecosystems** that are reliable, auditable, and trusted by users."
}
```

My journey began as a **Signal Corps Non-Commissioned Officer**, where I learned that uptime was mission-critical and clarity could mean the difference between success and failure. Today, I apply those lessons to ERP modernization, SaaS integrations, and AI-assisted DevOps, delivering systems that teams can rely on and scale with.

## Leadership Philosophy

> *Effective leadership isn't authority — it's responsibility for outcomes and creating more leaders.*

This philosophy drives everything I do - from technical project management to team building and organizational transformation. I believe in servant leadership, radical clarity, and creating systems that empower teams to deliver exceptional results.
