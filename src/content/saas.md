## 🔗 Integration Philosophy

> *"Effective ERP integration is not just about connecting APIs—it's about designing trustworthy workflows that mirror how your teams work."*

Whether synchronizing financial data across platforms or automating approval workflows, my integration approach prioritizes user adoption, data integrity, and audit compliance—ensuring systems serve people, not the other way around.
