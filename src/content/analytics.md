Data enables visibility, action, and accountability. As a Technical Project Manager, I use analytics to identify delivery risks, expose operational inefficiencies, and improve cross-functional coordination. This page highlights applied analytics across real-world projects and graduate-level training—with a focus on execution, not abstraction.

## 🛠 Real-World Analytics in Practice

### ✅ Asana AI Reporting for Project Risk

- Used Asana’s built-in AI to surface risk indicators, missed deadlines, and task velocity drops across parallel workstreams.
- Automated reports exported for weekly status calls with product owners and technical leads.
- Delivered early warnings and improved sprint closure predictability.

---

### 📊 Service Ops Dashboards via Smartsheet

- Designed Smartsheet dashboards to visualize NetSuite ticket volume, aging trends, and SLA compliance.
- Enabled Finance, IT, and Ops leaders to triage issues by type and urgency—reducing misalignment and delays.
- Created automated alerts to flag ticket stalling and SLA breaches.

---

### 🧾 NetSuite Saved Searches & Reporting

- Built and managed saved searches to deliver real-time visibility into finance and operations for 300+ internal and client users.
- Used formula fields to transform raw ERP records into metrics like AP aging, journal mismatch flags, and vendor exception patterns.
- Scheduled report emails and dashboards to reduce ad hoc exports and improve cadence of insight delivery.
- Enabled self-service analytics for Finance and client teams, cutting turnaround time on reporting requests.

📌 Result: Embedded real-time ERP analytics directly into operational decision-making.

### 🔁 Cross-Platform ETL Automation

- **Python-based ETL**: Automated Box → Vena file ingestion with schema validation and naming convention checks.
- **SQL for Ad Hoc Analytics**: Queried ERP and operational systems to support reporting needs.
- **Power Automate Pipelines**:
  - Outlook → Smartsheet parsing for onboarding and ticket intake.
  - Microsoft Teams post → Smartsheet sync for HR/IT workflows.
  - Built structured intake layers to support multi-department collaboration.

📌 Result: Eliminated spreadsheet-driven churn and improved accuracy, traceability, and confidence in cross-platform reporting.

## 📈 Project Metrics & Governance

I embed operational analytics into every program I manage—using data to guide retrospectives, validate assumptions, and surface execution risks early.

| Metric Type            | Use Case                                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint velocity        | Track bottlenecks and delivery slowdowns across sprints  |
| Ticket backlog aging   | Surface SLA violations and help triage prioritization    |
| Forecast accuracy      | Validate timeline expectations and onboarding throughput |
| Reconciliation metrics | Detect ERP sync issues across NetSuite, Ramp, Smartsheet |
