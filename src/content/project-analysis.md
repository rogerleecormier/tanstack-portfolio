title: "Project Risk Analysis – Budget Insights"
description: "Data-driven analysis of 4,000 project records exploring budget patterns, risk correlations, and financial distribution trends using statistical modeling and visualization."
---

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of **4,000 real-world project records** to explore how **budget correlates with risk level and complexity**. The goal is to surface patterns in budget allocation across projects and visualize how often projects fall into specific budget tiers—informing project scoping, resource allocation, and portfolio-level planning.

**Data Source:** [Kaggle – Project Management Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ka66ledata/project-management-risk-raw)

## 🧠 Observations

- The dataset is **right-skewed**, with most project budgets falling below $1.5M.
- Highest density appears in the $650K–$1.15M range.
- Very few projects exceed $2.5M, suggesting large projects are rare.
- **Implication:** Larger projects may require specialized risk frameworks and tailored resource strategies.

## 📊 Data Philosophy

> *"Data without context is just noise; analysis without action is just an academic exercise."*

My approach focuses on actionable insights that guide portfolio planning, risk mitigation, and executive decision-making—not just interesting charts.
